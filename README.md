# R-workshop
This repository contains the materials I created for an intro to R workshop at Stanford's Software and Services for Data Science.

You should start with the slides (the .pdf file) and then move to the Intro to R workshop.zip file when indicated in the slides.

The .zip file contains the R project file, script, and dataset I used for the workshop.
